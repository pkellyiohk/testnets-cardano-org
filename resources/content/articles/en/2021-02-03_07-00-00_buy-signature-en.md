# [Buy Signature](https://gitlab.com/mukn/glow/-/raw/master/dapps/buy_sig.glow)

Let's imagine you want to have your testament notarized. What would you do?

> You first write your testament
> You pay a notary to stamp it
> You store a copy for future reference

If you think about it, there are many interactions in the world that follow that same process:

-   When your diploma is certified by your University.
-   When you renew your driver's license, there is no test, just a renewal stamp.

We could generalize the  process as:

> A buyer (you in this case)
> Pays a seller
> Takes something, or better yet, a representation of the item (a digest) to a seller.
> The seller can now sign the digest.
> All parties can see that the digest was signed.

This is the interaction that the `buy_sig.glow` contract represents.

## Visualizing the Buyer and Seller interactions

## Glow code

    1    #lang glow
    2    @interaction([Buyer, Seller])
    3    let payForSignature = (digest : Digest, price : Nat) => {
    4      deposit! Buyer -> price;
    5      @verifiably!(Seller) let signature = sign(digest);
    6      publish! Seller -> signature;
    7      verify! signature;
    8      withdraw! Seller <- price;
    9    }

-  Buyer and seller have agreed to the terms of this sale. They both know what the signature is about, and they want to conduct this sale.
-  The digest of the message to sign is a parameter of the interaction, as is the convened price.
-  The buyer deposits the money according to the price.
-  The seller signs, but it is private only to the seller.
-  The signature is made public for everyone to see.
-  The signature is verified by everyone in a way that the contract enforces.
-  Finally, the money is transferred to the seller.

There are several things to note:

-  The code looks a lot like the sequence diagram we created before.
-  The lines of code with @Seller annotation are private.
-  The language itself takes care of prerequisites; If the buyer never deposits, then the seller never will be able to sign.

## Lessons learned

- Identify the participants of a contract with `@interaction`

- When an instruction is annotated with the participant's name, that value is private for the participant. Like `@verifiably!(Seller)`

- There are clear instructions for `deposit!` and `withdraw!`
